# Task3  Implementing simple and multiple linear regression.

**Housing Price Prediction**
*Predicting property values using real-world data*

We built a practical tool that estimates housing prices based on features like:
->Property size and room counts.
->Location perks (main roads, preferred areas).
->Amenities (AC, basement, hot water).
->Furnishing quality.

**-> How it works**
Data preprocessing: Cleaned and organized messy real estate data
Turned "yes/no" answers into 1/0 flags
Handled furnishing types (semi/fully furnished)
Math magic: Used linear regression to find price patterns
Validation: Tested accuracy with 20% unseen properties
Insights: Discovered what really moves property values

**-> What we found**
Size matters most: Square footage dominates pricing
AC adds value: Air conditioning boosts price nearly as much as extra space
Location premium: "Preferred area" homes cost ~28% more
Surprise: Basements didn't impact prices as expected

This isn't just academic, it helps:
Home buyers spot overpriced properties
Sellers price competitively
Investors find undervalued homes
Agents explain pricing factors to clients
